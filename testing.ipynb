      "2. Course ENVIRON 210: This course explores the physics, politics, economics, and environmental impact of the production, distribution, and use of known sources of energy. It allows students to work in groups to craft viable energy plans for the future, considering cost, environmental and human risk, and larger geopolitical impacts. This will give you a practical understanding of the economic aspects of environmental policies.\n",

      "3. Course EHS 588: This course introduces students to the field of environmental law and regulation, focusing on the major federal environmental pollution statutes. It also discusses natural resource protection, the Gulf oil spill, and climate change. The last two lectures focus on how far regulations can go before they constitute an unconstitutional taking of property. This will help you understand the legal and economic aspects of environmental policies.\n",
